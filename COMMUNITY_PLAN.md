Infinity Stones has assembled a well-connected team with strong technical background and deep understanding of the industry. By leveraging our relationships with other influencers in the industry and in the academic circles, we can help expand TRON’s influence in the academic community as well as in the industry. We will host a series of seminars and workshops to marketing TRON to both academia and major enterprises.

Infinity Stones is incubated and fully sponsored by Danhua Capital. We can explore potential opportunities for collaboration between TRON and any of the technology companies invested by Danhua, which will create synergy in the business development. We can also develop or migrate dApp projects on TRON. Danhua Capital has invested and is currently incubating a large number of dApp projects that can migrate to or develop a version based on TRON, which will help build up the TRON’s ecosystem.

With our knowledge and expertise on Cyber Security and Cloud Service, we are confident that Infinity Stones can help TRON to build a secure and reliable blockchain platform and expand the TRON ecosystem. We will provide the most advanced technology to protect all block producers from malicious attacks and provide the highest-level security auditing for all dApps running on the blockchain.

We hope that with our contribution, more people will realize the potential of TRON and the applications of the technology. We want to attract more developers and investor into the TRON ecosystem and make it the best choice for dApp development.
