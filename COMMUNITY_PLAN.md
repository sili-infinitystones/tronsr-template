1. The Infinity Stones has assembled a strong technology team of Ph.Ds and Faculties with world-class academic tracking record and leading industry experience. By leveraging these relationships and tracking records, the Infinity Stones can help expand TRON’s influence in the academic community and industry through the following ways

  * Host a series of seminars and workshops in world-renowned research institutes as well as industrial meetings. It is a way of marketing TRON to both academia and major enterprises.

  * Establish collaborations between TRON and research labs, to solve the most challenging blockchain technology problems. It will keep TRON’s leading position in the blockchain area.

  * Help TRON to publish technology breakthrough on world-top conferences and journals. It can attract serious researchers to build up their research on top of TRON, and change the world in a better way.

2. The Infinity Stones and Certik are both incubated by Danhua Capital. Danhua Capital is a leading VC investing in cutting-edge technologies, which has over 100 companies in its portfolio across both USA and China. The Infinity Stones can

  * explore potential opportunities for collaboration between TRON and any of these technology companies, which will create synergy in the business development.

  * develop or migrate dApp projects on TRON. Danhua Capital has invested and is currently incubating a large number of dApp projects that can migrate to or develop a version based on TRON, which will help build up the TRON’s eco-system.

3.  The Infinity Stones’ top-talent experts on the Cyber Security and Cloud Service can help TRON build up a secure and reliable blockchain platform in the following ways

  * Blockchain services have been attracting a significant amount of cyber attacks. The mechanisms for such attacks typically include: exploiting 0days in the service software (esp. Remote exploits); DDoS attacks; Phishing service operators or social attacks. It’s worth noting that, unlike traditional software, Blockchain software tends to have more openness. As a consequence, it’s more vulnerable to cyber attacks because exploiting open source software is much easier than exploiting close source software. The Infinity Stones has a team of leading system security experts with over 10 years’ experience in both academia and industry. The Infinity Stones feels pleased to cooperate with TRON on analyzing system level security holes and publishing periodical security patches to protect all super representatives from malicious attacks.

  * Smart contracts are open-sourced to hackers and immutable once deployed. Any hole in the smart contract comes with substantial attack benefits for attackers but great damage for the blockchains. In12/2017, $630 million has been lost to hackers, and recently hundreds of billions of ERC20 tokens (e.g., SMT) was illegally transferred due to a batch overflow bug in the smart contract. The Infinity Stones has established a wide-range partnership with Certik to provide highest-level security auditing for all dApps running on the blockchain. The Infinity Stones is very excited to collaborate with TRON on building up the verification tools for the dApps running on TRON.

4. Infinity Stones is incubated and fully sponsored by Danhua Capital. We can explore potential opportunities for collaboration between TRON and any of the technology companies invested by Danhua, which will create synergy in the business development. We can also develop or migrate dApp projects on TRON. Danhua Capital has invested and is currently incubating a large number of dApp projects that can migrate to or develop a version based on TRON, which will help build up the TRON’s ecosystem.


With our knowledge and expertise on Cyber Security and Cloud Service, we are confident that Infinity Stones can help TRON to build a secure and reliable blockchain platform and expand the TRON ecosystem. We will provide the most advanced technology to protect all block producers from malicious attacks and provide the highest-level security auditing for all dApps running on the blockchain.

We hope that with our contribution, more people will realize the potential of TRON and the applications of the technology. We want to attract more developers and investor into the TRON ecosystem and make it the best choice for dApp development.
