1) **Server**

128 vCPU, 3.8TB RAM, 4TB SSD

West US 2: $11,173.42 per month

WEST EUROPE: $27,275.14 per month

2) **Management**

The supernode will be hosted on a multi-cloud hybrid platform, which is developed in-house. It will allow us to seamlessly migrate the service to any major cloud provider and scale along with the traffic growth. 

3) **Reliability**

With a hybrid platform, we will set up multi-zone replication to achieve 99.995% availability. Monitoring and alerting systems (e.g. stackdriver) will be online for 7x24. The database will be backed up to a separate storage on a daily basis. We are going to have a dedicated devops team to stay on call for the TRON SR operation request.

4) **Security**

All internal data transfers will be encrypted. We will enable hardened JVM and OS image and also ensured the subscription of CVEs. All systems will be patched within 24 hours if there are any upstream fixes. We will enable secure boot or measured boot (when provided by the cloud provider).

5) **Ecosystem**

we feel pleased to cooperate with TRON on improving the on analyzing system level security holes and publishing periodical security patches to protect all super representatives from malicious attacks. Also, we can collaborate with TRON on building up the verification tools for the dApps running on TRON by leveraging our world-leading scientists on formal verification.
